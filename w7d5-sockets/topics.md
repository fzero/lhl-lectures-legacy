# Websockets

We'll start on something super bare-bones, then we'll play with a chat application in written in React.

* Client-side
  * We'll use the native Websocket API (no socket.io!) -  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API/Writing_WebSocket_client_applications
* Server-side
  * We'll use the bare-bones `ws` package - https://github.com/websockets/ws
  * It's pretty close to the browser implementation of sockets
