# W7D1 - Intro to node.js

- How to install/use node & npm
    + nvm is important too
- Node REPL
- npm 
    + it's like bundler and rake combined
    + Starting a project with `npm init`
    + Adding libraries
        * Global installation - for libraries providing CLI tools
        * Defining project dependencies
- Differences between working with JS on the browser vs. in node (`global` vs `window`, no jquery, `require`, `module.exports` etc.)
    + Using modules
        * Example: using `request` (https://github.com/request/request)
    + Creating your own modules
- Cool ES6 features in node
    + `const`, `let`, proper string templates, fat arrows
- Quick `Express` demo
    + It's like Sinatra!
    + It's javascript, so everything needs a callback
