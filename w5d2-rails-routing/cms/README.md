Lighthouse Labs lecture W5D2: Rails resourceful routes and namespacing

Be sure to look inside the `author.rb` model for notes on using slugs instead of ids for routing.

I've included the `web-console` gem and added it to the layout so you can play with the different path (`authors_path`, `new_author`, `author(id)` and so on) and link helpers (`link_to new_author`) right in the browser.
